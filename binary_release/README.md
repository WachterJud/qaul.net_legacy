Binary Releases
===============

Download the latest beta binaries from http://qaul.net/download/

qaul.net can spread itself. New users can download the installer for their OS directly 
from the qaul.net network. Every qaul.net device needs to contain therefore the qaul.net
installers for all provided operating systems. 

There are two kind of binaries:
* slim binaries: Is the name for those installers that do not contain all other 
  installers to share them directly after the first qaul.net start up. Slim binaries are 
  the ones downloadable from within the qaul.net network. After the first startup, the
  qaul.net application starts searching for all the missing installers from one of the 
  other qaul.net participants. The search and download for these binaries are run in the
  background without any user interaction. The sharing and downloading uses the qaul.net 
  file sharing system. The binaries are not displayed on the file sharing list of the GUI.
  Once all necessary installers have been successfully downloaded by a client it starts 
  providing them for download to new qaul.net users via the captive portal after the next 
  start up of the application.
* fat binaries: Fat binaries can be downloaded from the qaul.net web site from the 
  Internet. Those installers already contain all the installers for the other operating
  systems. After the first start up of the qaul.net application they can directly provide 
  the qaul.net installers as downloads to new users via captive portal and share the 
  installers to qaul.net participants with slim binaries via file sharing.
